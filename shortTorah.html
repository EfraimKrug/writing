       <p class=bodyText>There is a pasuk (Bereishis 32:21): v’amartem gam hinei avd’cha ya’akov achreinu ki amor achperah panauv b’mincha haholeches l’fanai acharia-chaen ereh phanauv u’lai yi’sa panai… </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Ya’akov Avinu is about to meet Esav, his brother, and Ya’akov is preparing a series of gifts with messengers. Each messenger brings animals, and is instructed to greet Esav in a specific way – saying a specific formula. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Then the Torah says: “Like this you will speak to Esav, when you find him. (and now our pasuk): “And you will say also this your servant Ya’akov after us; because he said I will atone (ach’parah) his face with a gift going before him and after that I will see his face – perhaps he will accept my presence”. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>It’s a difficult verse. I’ll break it up for clarity (and change the language a bit for convenience):</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Tell Esav this when you find him:</p>
       <p class=bodyText>Here comes Ya’akov after us because he said I’ll atone his face with a gift
       in front of him and after that I will see his face – maybe he’ll be my friend.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>What is the “because”?</p>
       <p class=bodyText>Ya’akov said the servant should say that, why? Because he said I will atone (who, the servant? Ya’akov? The Biblical Narrator?)</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Maybe it’s the servant… in other words, Ya’akov is telling the servant why the servant is going to bring the gifts.. like “Do this because otherwise you’re fired”… but here it is “Do this because he (the servant) said “I’ll atone...” - no. That just doesn’t work.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Let’s assume Ya’akov is speaking to the servant: So Ya’akov tells the servant to stand in front of Esav, and say: “Here comes Ya’akov after us”  Because he (Ya’akov) said I (Ya’akov) will atone – ok – that has possibility.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Let’s assume G-d is speaking to the reader: So Ya’akov tells the servant to stand in front of Esav, and say: “Here comes Ya’akov after us”  Because he (Ya’akov) said I (Ya’akov) will atone – so far so good… but wait, there’s more – his face with a gift going before him  - interesting – G-d is telling us Ya’akov’s motivation for sending the servants. Ok – but maybe out of place.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>I’m stuck. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>The pivotal word is achpara alauv – I will atone to him. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Rashi: I will nullify his anger. It seems to me (says Rashi) that every usage of “kaparah” that is next to iniquity and sin and next to face (panauv) – every one is the language of cleaning up – they are aramaic – there are many biblical examples in the talmud - “Cleaning the hands of that person” - and also in the language of scripture… like the Kohen “cleaning his hands”…</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Did that help? </p>

       <p class=bodyText>“And you will say also this your servant Ya’akov after us; because he said I will clean my hands (before) his face with a gift going before him and after that I will see his face – perhaps he will accept my presence”.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Yes! That answers everything – but, nebech, I don’t understand the answer, so I am going to look at Ramban. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Achparah panauv b’mincha: (Ah! He quotes all of the Rashi! Awesome!)</p>
       <p class=bodyText>Then he says that matches the Targum. But he still has a difficulty:</p>

       <p class=bodyText>If that is the explanation, that Ya’akov thought – in his heart – that he would achparah panauv – and the text tells us this because it would not have been right to tell the messengers to do this. (We figured that out (our first attempt) before we saw the Rashi – yay us!)</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Now, I think that the Ramban exhibits a deep, profound sensitivity to the language here… I hope you (Ronit) like it:</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Ramban now describes our problem with a moving time frame. There are two frames. First there is Ya’akov talking to the messengers. The second frame is the messenger in front of Esav. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Ramban understands the text will describe frame one, then frame two. Two discrete frames.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>In the first frame, Ya’akov tells the messenger what to say. There is a command.</p>
       <p class=bodyText>In the second frame, the messenger will say it. There is a request.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>The pasuk has three pieces of information:</p>
       <p class=bodyText>1) And you (messenger) will say also this your servant Ya’akov after us; (what the servant should do)</p>
       <p class=bodyText>2) I (Ya’akov) will kaparah (before) his face with a gift going before him (why the servant should do it)</p>
       <p class=bodyText>3) I will see his face – perhaps he will accept my presence (The hopeful outcome of the servants action)</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Ramban is saying there is a command in the first frame. Then there is this before-the-first-frame rationale, the initialization frame. Then there is the second frame – or a hopeful sentiment about what the second frame will be.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Now Ramban says the pasuk according to Rashi is:</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Then the Torah says: “Like this you will speak to Esav, when you find him. (and now our pasuk): </p>
       <p class=bodyText>[First frame = the command]</p>
       <p class=bodyText>And you will say also this: your servant Ya’akov is after us; </p>
       <p class=bodyText>[Still first frame – rationalization on the command]</p>
       <p class=bodyText>because he said I will atone (ach’parah) his face with a gift going before him </p>
       <p class=bodyText>[And this must still be the command, or the rationalization]</p>
       <p class=bodyText>and after that I will see his face – perhaps he will accept my presence”. </p>

       <p class=bodyText>Remember, Rashi says that kaparah means to cleanse… something that would happen with the gifts arrival to Esav.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>So Ya’akov tells his servants and gives a reason in the first frame. The reason is why he is commanding the servants, and not why are the servants talking to Esav.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Tell Esav this when you find him:</p>
       <p class=bodyText>Here comes Ya’akov after us because he said I’ll clean up my act...</p>

       <p class=bodyText>But “Clean up my act” is descriptive of frame 2, not frame 1.</p>

       <p class=bodyText>So Ramban says – don’t read echparah as ‘I want to clean up my act”. Read it properly the way it is in Mishlei – 16:14</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Chamas melech malachei maves v’ish chocham y’chaprena…. And then explained in the next pasuk: b’or pnai melech chaim ur’tzono c’av malkosh…</p>

       <p class=bodyText>The king’s wrath is [like] angels of death, but a wise man will appease it. In the light of the king’s countenance is life, and his favor is like a rain cloud”</p>

       <p class=bodyText>Achperenah, says Ramban says mishlei,  means, “I am opening myself up to relationship”.        </p>
