        <p class=bodyBigTitle>What, I am asking, is a 'blog'??</p>
        <p class=bodyTitle>Everyone wants to know!</p>
        <p class=bodyText>The word 'Blog' was not always a word. Many words were not always words, but 'Blog' was not a word until very recently. Before there was 'blog' there was 'weblog'. Some people say the next evolutionary landing was 'eblog', and there is a disagreement among web scholars as to how to pronounce 'eblog'. My own preference is Ebl / Og - e as in 'egg' and o as in 'throw'. I do not think anyone else anywhere agrees with me.</p>
        <p class=bodyText>The next step was to drop the 'e' completely and pronounce the word we have today, 'blog'. This was not instantaneously accepted. It took about 10 minutes from the time it was coined until the time it was a well known fact. </p>
        <p class=bodyText>I remember the day. It was sometime around 1987. My friend Charles asked me if I had made an entry in the web log. I said 'No - but I will right away.'<p>
        <p class=bodyText>Then Suzy looked up from her diligent web related activity, and said 'You mean the ebl Og?' And Tom, to everyone's surprise because he was about as un-web-savvy as a person could be in the last half of the 80's, "He means 'BLOG'!"</p>
        <p class=bodyText>Well the common proletariate hoisted Tom on their shoulders, and started to dance him around the perimeter of the office. First the Texas Two Step, and then a Polka.</p>
        <p class=bodyText>The refrain to the whole thing was:</p>
        <p class=bodyText>Tom is the dude who is blogging all the time<br>
        And the Blog is the web log when you had a little wine<br>
        Wine is the stuff you have on a bad day<br>
        And Blogging is what you have to do anyway.</p>
