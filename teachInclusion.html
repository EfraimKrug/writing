          <p class=bodyBigTitle>Central Concept:</p>

          <p class=bodyText>As a society we need to be inclusive on many levels – everyone talks about it – but nobody is actually teaching us how to be inclusive! We are at the end of possibility – it can’t get worse – we have shootings (by excluded people), we have public humiliations (by excluded people), we have hate mongering (by excluded people). We need to be inclusive.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Thesis: our concept of “society” is changing faster than we – as a human race – can react to it. Now – it  has happened – a kid has been excluded (whatever that means) and has gone on to buy weapons, walk into his school and – you know the rest. A man has been excluded (whatever that means) and has gone to his weapons collection and carried weapons to Las Vegas and – you know the rest. This seems to be happening more and more.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Approaches: There are a number of approaches we can take (as Americans, as human beings). And many of them are being discussed publicly. I don’t know what will work – I would not make a claim to know such a thing. Many people are making those claims – that they know – but I don’t believe them. I don’t believe anyone has the answers – and together we need to figure out what to do.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>One: Pass laws to prevent unstable people from buying weapons. This may be great – but as Americans we see the debate itself is causing a rift in our country. If we pass laws – does that infringe on the right to bear arms? If we don’t pass laws – are we abandoning our children in dangerous schools?</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Other questions also necessarily come up – who is crazy? The Las Vegas incident was perpetrated by an upstanding member of his community. Nobody suspected such a thing.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Who is monitoring stability?</p>
          <p class=bodyText>That question alone could cause a civil war!</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Two:  Determine who should have been responsible and bring them to trial. The Florida incident shows us that just as many people determine the police should have been responsible, the students answer the accusations with “but the police saved our lives”. It gets confusing.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Furthermore, if we can imagine the FBI gets a lot of leads – many false, many true – hey have to determine where to follow up and where not to follow up.  If I imagine how such a list might move through the system – a central office determines threats – and sends regional offices the list in their region… Evidently the FBI gets 1000’s of tips every day.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>The computer intelligence to filter those tips effectively is partially developed. We don’t have perfect facial recognition yet and terror recognition would seem to be much more difficult. Remember – we still have no idea how to identify the shooter in Las Vegas – how can we possibly identify someone like  him?</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Three: Arm teachers. I have some feelings about that – but in short- I want my children to engage with loving teachers who are actively doing everything they can to draw kids close. A teacher packing a piece does not fit the bill (for me… I understand different school systems might come up with different answers than I do).
          In short: We have a lot of things we can do – but nothing that will necessarily lead us down the right path. I am suggesting that we have to change our society – all the way through – but that doesn’t mean changing the economic model, or the environmental model – it means we change the ‘how do we treat each other’ model.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Last year I was teaching Statistics. I gave my students the task of determining – as they walked through the halls of the school – how many nice greetings and how many not-nice greetings they got. Some of the students said that it depends on how they greeted the other person first.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>My question – why wouldn’t every child greet every other child with a smile? I personally started greeting everyone (students and teachers) with a smile and greeting. And I told the kids – if someone greets you with a smile, and you don’t return it? You’re stealing their humanity.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>This is inclusion – 101: “….receive everyone with a cheerful face.” - Pirkei Avos 1:15</p>

          <p class=bodyBigTitle>Teachers:</p>

          <p class=bodyTitle>Classroom Teachers</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Teachers often get a raw deal in America. They want to teach – and they are saddled with difficulties beyond compare. In a completely normal classroom, they have to be the administrator keeping track of attendance, they have to be the police force – demanding respect and good behavior, they have to be the teacher – actually leading kids through content, they have to be special needs coordinator – making sure the faster kids and slower kids are all progressing. I have the utmost respect for the profession – and I have seen in my brief time at FRCS some truly amazing teachers.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>I would never want to add more to the burden. And still – I will ask the question – when you are standing in the hallways – are you inviting students into your life? I don’t mean your personal life – that would be so inappropriate – I mean your professional life.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>In other words – when you see a child at 7:30 in the morning, blurry eyed walking to class, do you smile and say “Hi Joey – it’s so nice to see you here this morning!” and mean it? It is obviously hard for Joey to summon up the strength to come back for a another day of getting schooled… Joey is a world in himself – we have no idea how difficult it is for him.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>One time I had a kid tell me “Mr Krug – my brother’s mother just died”. (Complicated family). She didn’t know if she could be sad or not… she didn’t have a clear understanding of what loving her brother means! Where is the rule book?</p>

          <p class=bodyText>She and I just cried together. Sometimes all you can do – is cry together. Without saying it – I related to her “You are in my heart so much – all we can do is cry together”.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>That is inclusion.</p>

          <p class=bodyTitle>Adults – in our kids lives</p>

          <p class=bodyText>This is the deepest, and the most difficult. It seems that my children are by definition included in my life. But sadly enough – it’s not true. We need to invite them into our lives every chance we get.
          There is an educator in New York – a fantastic speaker – who talks about recharge for our kids. He says that kids – of all ages (into their 40’s and 50’s) need to come to their parents for a recharge. And he says – as a parent – you have to give it to them when they need it. As a parent – you have to be ready to drop everything and give it to them – when they need it.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>About a week ago – my daughter came in the door slowly. Something didn’t seem right – you know – like you can smell something is different. I asked her – is everything ok? She stepped close to me… I put my arms around her… and she just started weeping.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>We stood there for a long time. She wept for a long time.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>I have no idea what was wrong. I don’t know if she knows what was wrong. But while she was in my arms – she was safe.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>That is inclusion.</p>

          <p class=bodyTitle>Adults in normal society</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Classroom Teachers are by no means the only teachers. Whenever I speak to my children, I am teaching them. Whenever I speak to my kid’s friends – I am in a teacher role. When I check out at the grocery store – I’m an adult and the cashier is a high school student – I am in a teacher role. This kind of teacher role is a little more selfless – and it seems that it is not possible to have as much of an impact. Or maybe you can have more.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Here’s the story: I was cashing out at the grocery store, and the cashier was a high school kid. I knew that not only by estimating his age, but I have seen him at my daughter’s high school. As I checked out – he asked me if I had found everything alright.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>I admit – I’m a wise-ass sometimes. I asked him back why he cared? In other words, I am there, checking out – I’m probably not going to go off in search for something I didn’t find… why does he care?</p>

          <p class=bodyText>He answered me – if I found everything alright I would probably not be so ornery at the checkout and that would make his life easier.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>But the story doesn’t end there. I remembered the kid. And I remember his response.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Now listen to this. I saw that kid at the high school with his mother. They were getting ready to leave, and I walked up to them and asked – are you his mother? She said that she was. And I said - “Your son gave me such a smart, insightful response at the grocery store the other day… “ and I related the conversation. I ended by saying that I really was quite impressed with his response!</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Without saying it – I related to him “You are in my heart so much – I can tell good stories about you”.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>That – is inclusion.</p>

          <p class=bodyTitle>Adults in web space</p>

          <p class=bodyText>This is the most difficult, the most unexplored territory. As a human race – we don’t even know what the web is, or can be. Is it safe? It’s only a computer. But there is cyber bullying. There are sleazy adults posing as kids… for what ends?</p>

          <p class=bodyText>And here – our kids have their own worlds… how do I get included into that? Or what would it mean to include my children into my world?</p>

          <p class=bodyBigTitle>Do we spy on our children?</p>
          <p class=bodyText>Obviously, the last thing our children need is to feel untrusted – like we are spying on them… and yet – I very much want / or need to know what they are getting into! How else can I keep my kids safe?</p>

          <p class=bodyBigTitle>Do we trust our children?</p>
          <p class=bodyText>We’d better. They are going to be handling the planet after us – it’s their world. But we have to give them guidance – hopefully good, thoughtful guidance. The next few years are not going to be easy, I guarantee it.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Do we just allow them unsupervised web access?</p>
          <p class=bodyText>I don’t have any answers here.</p>

          <p class=bodyBigTitle>What is inclusion?</p>
          <p class=bodyText>Here – I have some thoughts. Just as we have to model our human interactions in the rest of the world – maybe we should be continuously modeling our web interactions. Imagine – your child is entering a park for the first time – there are lots of people – some sell things, some are just hanging out with their parents, with their kids or friends. Everyone is doing something – and some are savory, and some are not so much so.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>I walk with my child – I hold his hand – and we see someone selling – say balloons. We interact – I ask how much the balloons are and I include that balloon salesman in my life in some way – I talk about balloons and whatever I find. And my child sees me modeling inclusion.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>But my child is only 5 and I don’t want them to make decisions yet about who to include and who not to. Can I explain my choices? A 5 year old doesn’t have the intellect to process such things. So I say “Don’t talk to strangers” and I do talk to strangers, leaving the child with the recognition that the world is more complicated than it appears – not scarier, and not dangerous – just more complicated.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Maybe I can also model this on the web.</p>

          <p class=bodyText>Maybe we can join groups together – and we can determine who to hangout with – and who to include into our lives… and what information to give and how to wait to give it.</p>
